    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

    Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human language in a valuable way.

    Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to extract meaningful information from digital images or videos.

    Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It's inspired by behavioral psychology and has been successfully applied to game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.

    Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain expertise.
